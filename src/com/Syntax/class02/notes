------------------------HTML----------------
All the webapplication
are developed using Html.


HTML---->

tags:

<html>
	<body>
		<button> heelo </button>
	</body>
</html>



---------------------WebElement-----------------

WebElement:
Anything you see on website is called a webElement

Some common WebElements:

1.Text Boxes
2.Radio Buttons
3.CheckBoxes
4.Calendars
5.Drop Downs
6.Tables


-------------------------Atrributes----------------:

<button>My button</button>
text is written between the opening and closing tags.


<button  class="abc" ,id= "Butn">my button </button>

what ever we have inside the tag is called attribute

what is the value of the attribute class---> answer: "abc"
what is the value of the attribute id --> answer: "Butn"


----------------------------Locators----------------------------------
Locators:
locators help us find a particular webElement on the page

- ID
- Name
- ClassName
- linktext
- partialLinkText
- Tagname
- xpath
- CSS Selector

the purpose of having multiple locators is because
some tags might not have an id (u can use another locator)

two webElements have a common locator  (e.g  <input id="box" ,name="textbox"/>
 											, <input id="box",class= "btn" )


----------------------------------DOM-------------------------
What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
internal view of the webpage.
Also called as Developer's tools, or Dev tools
Document --> can be stored any document as pdf, excel
Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

--------------------------anchor tag---------
<a> --> anchor tag
usually the links are placed in this tag
 if there is a text in the <a > tag then u can use linktext locator


--------------------------NOSUCH ELEMENT EXCEPTION---------
 NOSUCH ELEMENT EXCEPTION:
 occurs when the Driver is unable to find the element on the page
 1.the locator is wrong
 2.the element is not on that page.



-----------Duplicate Values of attributes---------


<input id="box" ,name="Username"/> -->Username Box
<input id="box",class= "password"/>  -->Password Box

for the sake of example:
driver.findElement(By.id("box")).sendKeys("heelo");

driver is going to go in the DOM from top to botton , the first tag with id box will be picked and
keys will be sent to that.

-------------------------------RECAP--------------------------------

1.locators--> id,name,class,partialLinkText, linktext

2.linktext--->only when we have a link tag <a> and it has some text
3.partail and link text --> using partial u can enter just a part of the text
4.if there is numbers in the value of the locators .. should u use it? (avoid it)
5.No such element element -->1.the locator is wrong, 2. the element is on the page
6 send the text and perform click operation
