Q.difference between  driver.quit() and driver.close()
-- close() --> it will close the current tab only
-- quit() ---> it will quit thw whole browser



			Comparison

driver.get()  =======  driver.navigate().to()


-- driver.get() is going to wait for the page to fully load before proceeding further
where as driver.navigate() will not wait for the page to fully load


-- navigate() keeps the history of the browser.
--- navigate() allows you to move forward , backward and refresh the page
additional option we get with navigate();
driver.navigate().back();
driver.navigate().forward();
driver.navigate().refresh();




fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see url, tabs, bookmarks
    and fullscreen() will maximize the whole web application
